Technologies and Languages
====================

###Flask back-end with:

  * Jinja2 for templating
  * Flask-login for user session management
  * sqlite possibly with Flask-SQLAlchemy as Object Relational Mapper
  
I find myself to be very productive in Python, and I've used it for a variety of projects before. Out of the available Python web framework, I want to use Flask due to being lightweight, yet extensible. As it's widely used there are stable, well-documented libraries available for most common use cases, as shown by the extensions already chosen. For the database behind the application, I want to use sqlite as it's the simplest option, and is easy to store with the application. I am much less confident in this choice than I am in choosing Flask.
 

###Front-end:

 * CoffeeScript compiled into JavaScript
 * jQuery for easy event handling and DOM element selection, with many other features being potentially useful
 * styling will be done in SASS compiled into CSS
 * Bootstrap will form the base of the project
 * Backbone.js might be included if required
 
I want to keep the complexity of the front-end code to a minimum. Ideally, I would like to use it only for display, with the logic being performed by the back-end where possible. I'm not sure that having an MCV framework will be necessary, at least not at the start. I'm not sure if this is the best approach but if I find that my front-end code had grown to need it.
