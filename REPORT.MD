##or how I learned to stop worrying and love the Flask##


###Introduction###
	
I set out to build a website on which users could challenge each other to cook various recipes and be awarded points based on the quality of their posts and submissions. In this scenario, quality is indicated by the interest of other users as measured by the number of submissions and the number of upvotes each submission received.

I think that this goal has been achieved and through implementing it and the additional features included in the project I have demonstrated my software engineering skills such as use of source control, writing well-organized code, or identifying and implementing useful refactorings. As such, the project achieved the learning outcomes of the course and deserves a high mark.
