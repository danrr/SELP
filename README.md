###Baseline

###Strech-goals



Technologies and Languages
====================
Flask backend with:
  * Jinja2 templating
  * Flask-login for user session management
  * sqlite for a database
  

Frontend will be built in coffeescript compiled into javascript, styling will be done in SCSS compiled into CSS using compass, which will also handle spriting of images.
